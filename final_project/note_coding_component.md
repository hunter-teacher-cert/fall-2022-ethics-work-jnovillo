## Note

The algorithm applies cracking and packing techniques to generate gerrymandering. If none of these techniques work, our algorithm will raise an exception with this message “Too many iterations”. When you run the algorithm and get that exception, please run it again.

We wanted to make an algorithm that runs fast, which is why it does not go over all the possibilities of gerrymandering, and we get that exception. It will also require more time to optimize the algorithm.
