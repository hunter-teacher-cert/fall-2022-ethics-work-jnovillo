### Home security systems can be hacked

The primary purpose of home security systems is to secure families and their properties by protecting them from burglary, home intrusion, fire, and environmental disaster. However, these systems can be hacked. Security companies have implemented various security methods to protect customers from being hacked, but the threat remains. For instance, hackers can access a home security camera, observe the movements and hear conversations of the family, and they can also have access to the wireless network and then take control of the cameras and other devices around the house.
